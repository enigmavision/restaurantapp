# restaurantapp

## Overview
This app is the result of an in-class collaboration. We have created an app to make a restaurant reservation at a 5-table establishment, with a waiting list that contains only 2 entries. We have used Materialize CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, and Express to create a dynamic website attached to a local server. The user can view current reservations, make a new reservation, and see their completed reservation.
